"""
run.py
------
Script to generate a new permutation for coffee chats. To use, first install
the randoffee library. Then `cd` to the `Coffee` folder in the REG SharePoint,
and run:

    python -m randoffee.run

This script requires the following files to be present in the working directory
(the `Coffee` folder should already have all of these).

1. `include`
   A CSV file containing names and emails of people who are participating in
   the coffee. Each line should have the format {name},{email}.

2. `exclude`
   Same format as above. The exclude file overrides the include file, so if
   somebody is in both, they will be excluded.

   For a more temporary exclusion (e.g. for people on leave), you can pass the
   email address as an argument to the script, e.g.

        python randomise.py -e flast@turing.ac.uk

The script will generate random groups of 4 or 5 people, along with the
complete text for an email. This text is automatically copied to the clipboard
in RTF format, and can then be pasted into the desktop version of Outlook (or
the macOS Mail.app).
